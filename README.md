The goal of this project is to compare various artificial intelligence methods in terms of variable selection and feature construction used in the credit scoring process.

A comprehensive analysis will be conducted on the differences in the sets of variables selected and created by different AI models, including but not limited to: neural networks, XGBoost, random forest, and TPOT. The models' performance will be evaluated, and the differences in their chosen feature sets will be explained using XAI techniques.

The dataset for this analysis focuses on loan repayments in the banking sector.
